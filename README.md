A simple HTML website with an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.  
Every time I update the website, it automatically deploys to GitHub Pages.

## How It Works

- GitHub Actions checks out the code every time a change is pushed to the `main` branch.
- The workflow then deploys the website automatically to GitHub Pages.
- This ensures continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## Tech Used

- HTML (basic website)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
